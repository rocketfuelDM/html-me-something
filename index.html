                    <p>"This was the first placed I lived. It was a really cool place to live at first.
                        The whole community came together once per year to celebrate. We had a neighborhood
                        parade and bbq every year. All of us kids would run around all night and the parents
                        socialized...it brings back fond memories. I lived here until I turned 13.

                    <p>"I moved to O'Fallon, Missouri after highschool. At the time I had very little
                        experience with St. Charles County. I have now lived here for 17 years and couldn't
                        be any more pleased. O'Fallon is a great place to raise a family."
